# hangman-game

Project Zero Hangman
User Stories.

- I am going to be making a hangman game.
- start button
- display a hint of the word generated
- On the screen there is going to be a user input for a letter to guess.
- As well as a sumbit button for the user to press to sumbit the guess.
- I am going to have some images for each wrong anser
- When the user loses some text pops up on screen and says you have been hanged.
- If user wins some text appear on screen that you have won and not been hanged.
- use words that are more then five letters wrong.

- My MVP is going to be very simple.

2.  I want to deleiver a product that simply has a box for the user to input a letter.

- If the letter is wrong add a image
- if the letter is correct display it in the area for the word to appear

3.  six screen elements.
4.  1 array of marvel superheros to loop thru to randomly generates a hero.
5.  Display a hint on the screen once selected.

- My stretch goals would be to make the game look pretty.
- Maybe have five different cattegories.
- Some good visiual animation on the hangman would be a strech goal as well.
- multiple themes
