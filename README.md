# hangman-game

Project Zero Hangman
User Stories.
I am going to be making a hangman game. On the screen there is going to be a user input for a letter to guess. As well as a ? button for the user to press to sumbit the guess. I will also have a trys left area where it will keep track of remaining tries the user has. I am going to have some styling that will add the shapes of a stick figure untill and wil add a body part everytime the user misses a word. When the user loses some text pops up on screen and says you have been hanged. If user wins some text appear on screen that you have won and not been hanged.

My MVP is going to be very simple. I want to deleiver a product that simply has a box for the user to input a letter and five basic screen elements. I am going to try to make some catogeries i.e horror movies, marvel superheros for the user to select and then randomly generate a title or name from the category they selected. I am going to put the contents of the theme into the array. Which once the user picks a theme will randomly generate a title or hero from the array.

My stretch goals would be to make the game look pretty. Maybe have five different cattegories. Some good visiual animation on the hangman would be a strech goal as well.
